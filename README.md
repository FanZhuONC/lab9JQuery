I use lightbox css/js linked into my html; but i donot know how to upload things into different folder, so everything is in the same place now, images as well, it probably wont work unless sort all images into images folder and lightbox jquery css/js into lightbox folder ; 
zip file uploaded on blackboard; download that one might work well. ;)
